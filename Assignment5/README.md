## Description
Home assignment 5. In this project I've added virtual methods (strike, openFire, and ultraMove) and tested their functionality explicitly and through base class pointers in the hierarchy of classes described in *Home assignment 3.
(*Home assignment 3: This project is about the hierarchy of classes. It defines classes such as 'Autobot', 'Decepticon', 'Transformer', 'Weapon', and 'Planet' to model the characteristics and behaviors of these entities. The project includes unit tests written with Google Test.)
